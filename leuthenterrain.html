      <h1>Club Projects - Leuthen: Building the Terrain</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;<br>
            At all of our displays or Leuthen, the one element that has attracted the most interest
            was the terrain itself and more specifically how we achieved the realistic snowy terrain
            effect. Our challenge had always been to visually recreate this terrain in 15mm scale and
            not fall into the "all white" snow board effect. Hopefully the section of the article will
            reveal how we tackled this challenge. </p><br>
            <p>After some careful consideration (or inspired guesswork) we decided a table size of 8 feet
            by 6 feet would give us the right size to be able to field all the units we were planning on
            painting. Our previous experience of putting on show games have long taught us that the boards
            need to be strong, so we settled on 2 inch thick styrofoam as the base, with 1 inch pieces forming
            the hills. Also to minimise the number of seams, we ordered 2 feet by 3 feet and 2 feet by 2
            feet board sizes.</p><br>
            <img src="images/terrain1.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Leuthen map drawn on styroform terrain">
            <p>As a first step the boards were laid out and the map of the battle field was sketched out with
            an indelible marker pen. The finished map appeared quite busy with terrain features, so a number
            of roads and smaller villages were removed to provide for better playability. The key features
            were retained; we are wargamers and not Hollywood directors after all!</p><br>
            <img src="images/terrain2.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Leuthen with styroform hills">
            <p>Each hill was created by first cutting its outline in card. This was then sellotaped to the
            1 inch styroform and it acted as a template for the hot wire cutter. Once cut out the hills
            were chamfered using the hot wire cutter and glued into place on the main boards. They were
            then sanded with rough sandpaper to remove the sharp relief. Also, to provide balance and
            give a more mixed relief to the boards, a hot air gun was used to sink some areas of the main board.</p><br>
            <p>Next came the roads. These were pasted on in polyfiller using a 1 inch paint scraper. They
            were then inlayed by dragging the reverse end of four paint brushes along then and additional
            pitted effects were added by dotting the roads with the brushes in various places.</p><br>
            <img src="images/terrain3.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Building up the Leuthen terrain">
            <p>The built up areas and streams were given a coat of PVA and sanded to give a textures effect.
            The fields near these terrain features were made from Dolls House carpet with additional grass
            glued onto it.</p><br>
            <p>The streams were cut into the boards using a soldering iron turned side on to give an initial
            wide cut. The soldering iron was then turned thin ways to provide the deeper cuts for the stream
            itself. To give the raised "hang over the edge" effect, milliput was rolled out and kneaded along
            the edges of the streams. Bridges were scratch built.</p> <br>
            <p>Now that all the main terrain features were in place, the boards were painted all over with
            a Dulux emulsion mix of chocolate brown. The roads and built up areas were then highlighted with
             some judiciously heavy dry brushing. Everywhere else on the boards was covered in a neat coat
             of PVA and the first coat of scatter applied. The second coat of scatter was then applied as
             were the grass edges to the streams and hills. Everything was then sealed using a mix of PVA
             and water applied through a spray gun.</p><br>
             <img src="images/terrain4.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="birds eye view of Leuthen ">
             <p>To provide the iced/frosty effect to the boards, we dry brushed all the roads, streams
             end built up areas in white. Candle wax was melted into the stream beds and marshy areas.
             The buildings, mainly from Hovels and Timecast, were also dry brushed in white.</p><br>
             <img src="images/terrain5.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Leuthen terrain with icy look">
              <p>The church, which provided the famous "last stand" for the Austrian's was scratch
              built using foamcore board covered in Tetrion. The churchyard walls were cast from a
              master made using expanded polystyrene to give the cobbled effect. The winter trees,
              which attracted so much comment at the shows, were in fact Super Trees from Scenery
              Express. These were attached to pins and they are inserted into the boards on the
              day of the game.</p> <br>
              <img src="images/terrain6.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Leuthen terrain with snow effect">
              <img src="images/terrain7.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Leuthen terrain with icy roads">
              <p>The final snow fall is also added on the day of the game. Woodland Scenics
              Snow is used for this. Not only does it look very good, but it does not leave
              behind a powdery effect when shaken from the boards.</p><br>
